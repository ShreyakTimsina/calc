          <h3 class="section-title">What are Stocks/Shares?</h3>
          <p>
            Stock is all of the shares into which ownership of a corporation or
            a business is divided. All the shares of a company are collectively
            called stock. Usually people own shares of a company and are known
            as the shareholders which means that they own certain percentage of
            the business they are shareholders of.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Shares can be bought and sold on the stock market or the Stock
            Exchange. Buying and selling of shares is collectively known as
            trading and it one of the methods of earning money from the Stock
            Market. Someone could buy a share for a lower value and sell it for
            a higher value and vice versa. There's a risk of going to loss if
            you're not careful enough and buy shares when the index is
            relatively high than it usually is.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="section-title">Dividend</h4>
          <p>
            A dividend is a payment made by a company to its shareholders as the
            distribution of its profits. When a corporation earns a profit, it
            distributes certain amount to its shareholders and uses the rest of
            the amount to re-invest in the business itself so that the business
            grows every year and be able to pay more dividends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A shareholder is liable to pay taxes for the dividend received by
            them as it a form of income. The companies distribute dividend based
            on the face value and not on the basis of the value they are traded
            in the stock market. So if a company had initially issued its share
            at Rs 100 which is usually the case, it pays the dividend based on
            that amount. If a company announces that it will distribute 20%
            dividend it means 20% of the face value and not the share value. So,
            usually when a company is giving out dividends it is usually the
            same amount as the percentage per share which in this case is Rs 20
            .
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4 class="section-title">Bonus Shares</h4>
          <p>
            Bonus shares are given to the shareholders without any additional
            cost, based upon the number of shares they own. A company
            distributes bonus shares to give the shareholders the return they
            want from their investment which in turn also increases the
            company's paid-up capital. It also allows the company to give
            returns to its shareholders without distributing money.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A company distributes bonus shares based on the number of shares a
            shareholder has. If a company announces that it will give 20% bonus
            shares to its shareholders it means that the shareholders get 20
            free new shares for every 100 shares they own. The value of share is
            decreased in the stock market so that the market capitalization
            remains the same as before the distribution of the bonus shares and
            this process is known as price adjustment. It is upto the market if
            the price of the shares get increased or decreased after the
            distribution.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Bonus Shares compound annually so if someone owns 100 shares of a
            company and receives 20% bonus, his total shares change to 120 and
            the next time the company distributes bonus shares it is on this new
            amount so he will receive 24 bonus shares if the company gives out
            20% bonus shares again.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3 class="section-title">How does the calculator work?</h3>
          <p>
            The calculator for the investment in stock market takes in the
            initial quantity of shares and its price from the users and give the
            total cost of the investor also taking into account the fees they
            have to pay. It also takes in the estimated bonus and dividend that
            the user thinks the company would give in average in the coming
            years which can be guessed looking at the past distributions made by
            the company. It also asks the users to enter the time period of
            their investment and the price they think each share will have after
            the time period of their investment. Any of the fields can be left
            empty if the user does not want to consider it for their investment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The tax for the received dividend and bonus shares is cut from the
            dividend amount. While calculating the capital gain tax the price of
            the bonus shares is taken as Rs 100 although we have to pay Rs 5 per
            bonus shares we receive. The calculator calculates the result after
            taking into account all types of taxes and fees in the stock market.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As the shareholders receive bonus and their number of shares is
            increased the amount received as dividend also increases. This is
            because dividend is certain amount given to the shareholders for
            each share they own. So, Although the amount received as dividend is
            low in the starting years it catches up with simple interest in few
            years and even passes it in the next few years. This is without
            considering the price of the bonus shares received by the
            shareholders.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="section-title">Should I go for it?</h3>
          <p>
            Although the returns yielded from the stock market is much higher
            than that of <a href="simpleEnglish.html">Simple Interest</a> and
            <a href="compoundEnglish.html">Compound Interest</a> , it comes with
            its own risks related to the market too. One who takes calculated
            risks and invests in strong corporations earns the higher reward
            that comes with the high risk. It is upto you if you choose to
            invest your money in the stock market as it comes with its own
            risks.
