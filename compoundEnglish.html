          <h3 class="section-title">What is Compound Interest?</h3>
          <p>
            Compound interest is an interest based on the initial principal,
            which also takes into account all of the accrued interest from
            previous periods. It is the addition of interest to the principal so
            that interest can be generated based on the new amount. Compound
            interest is the interest based on the previous interests so it is
            also known as interest on interest. It is the reinvesting of
            interest, rather than clearing it on the same period, so that
            interest in the next period is then earned on the principal and the
            previously accumulated interest.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="section-title">How does the calculator work?</h3>
          <p>
            The calculator for the compound interest is based on the formula
            widely used to calculate compound interest. The app takes the
            Initial Capital or the Principal, the period of Time in years for
            which the amount is deposited and the yearly Interest Rate as input
            from the users and runs the values through the formula and gives the
            Total Interest Accrued, The Final Amount and The Average Interest
            Yield for all the years. On compounding and increasing the years the
            average yearly interest increases and the interest of the previous
            year is added to the principal.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3 class="section-title">Should I go for it?</h3>
          <p>
            Compound interest yields more interest with time than
            <a href="simpleEnglish.html">Simple interest</a> even if the rate of
            interests are same in both the cases. Compound Interest yields
            interest on the previously accumulated interest too whereas in
            simple interest, accumulated interest is not added to the principal
            during the current period orf any other upcoming periods. We would
            suggest you to rather invest your money in somewhere it compounds
            than somewhere it doesn't although the decision should all be
            completely yours.
